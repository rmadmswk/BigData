                                      While the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n26

level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

         I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                                     The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41
